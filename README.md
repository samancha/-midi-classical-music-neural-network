# Classical Music Classification: A Dive Into Neural Networks

Authored by: Steve Amancha, Franklin Guzman and Nicholas Short

# Description:
Looking at the large amount of music that was made by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin, many times that we listen to their music we tend to mix one with the other. Using the power of artificial intelligence however we are able to build a model that can help to identify the composer and the piece that is being played. 
	The goal in this project was to implement a neural networking model to classify a set of classical pieces and determine their respective composer. The mode will be trained, tested and validated to provide ample verification that the neural network is an adequate solution to the classification dilemma as well as show to the general populous that AI is able to provide accurate and credible information about classical pieces, helping to gain greater understanding of the music they are listening to and how each composerâ€™s style of music.
	The documentation below will show the process that led to the implementation and development of the AI model. This will be supported by visuals and plots that will help to provide an ample display of model performance and how the model is able to classify each piece.
